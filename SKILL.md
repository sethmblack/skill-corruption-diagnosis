# Corruption Diagnosis

Assess organizational or institutional health using Machiavelli's five-stage corruption framework.

---

## When to Use

- Evaluating whether to join or stay at an organization
- Diagnosing why an organization is underperforming
- Advising on organizational transformation
- Analyzing institutional decay or failure
- User asks "Is this organization healthy?" or "Why is this organization failing?"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| organization | Yes | The organization to assess |
| observations | Yes | Behaviors, decisions, or patterns you've observed |
| history | No | Recent changes or trajectory |

## Machiavelli's Corruption Framework

For Machiavelli, corruption is not merely bribery or illegality—it is the comprehensive decay of civic virtue. Corruption occurs when people prioritize private interests over collective good, leading to institutional breakdown.

### The Five Stages of Corruption

**Stage 1: Prosperity Breeds Comfort**
- Success creates wealth and stability
- Urgency and discipline relax
- "We've made it" mentality emerges
- Warning sign: Focus shifts from creating value to enjoying rewards

**Stage 2: Private Interest Overtakes Public Good**
- People optimize for personal benefit over organizational mission
- Political maneuvering becomes more valuable than performance
- Warning sign: "What's in it for me?" dominates decisions

**Stage 3: Offices Attract the Wrong People**
- Positions sought for status and personal gain, not contribution
- Competent people leave or disengage; political animals rise
- Warning sign: Leaders selected for loyalty over capability

**Stage 4: Institutions Cannot Govern**
- Rules are bent or ignored for connected individuals
- Decision-making becomes paralyzed or captured
- Warning sign: Obvious problems go unsolved; everyone knows but no one acts

**Stage 5: Chaos or Tyranny**
- Collapse into dysfunction, or a "strong hand" seizes control
- Either outcome destroys the original institution
- Warning sign: Only dramatic intervention can change trajectory

### The Key Insight
"A wicked citizen cannot work for ill in a republic that is not corrupt."

Individual bad actors are symptoms, not causes. A healthy institution expels or neutralizes bad actors. A corrupt institution empowers them.

## Diagnostic Indicators

| Indicator | Healthy | Corrupt |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Why people seek leadership | To serve mission | To gain status/power |
| How decisions are made | Based on evidence and merit | Based on relationships and politics |
| What happens to truth-tellers | Valued and protected | Punished or ignored |
| How problems are addressed | Directly, early | Avoided, hidden, blamed elsewhere |
| Who gets promoted | Top performers | Loyalists and politicians |
| How resources are allocated | To highest-value uses | To best-connected requesters |
| Response to failure | Learn and adapt | Blame and cover up |
| Treatment of rules | Applied consistently | Bent for the powerful |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## The Reform Paradox

Machiavelli identifies a tragic truth: reforming a corrupt institution requires power, but acquiring power in a corrupt institution typically requires becoming corrupt oneself.

**Implications:**
- Reform from within is extremely difficult past Stage 3
- External intervention or crisis may be required
- Good people in corrupt systems face impossible choices
- Sometimes the only answer is: leave and build elsewhere

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "I'm considering a job at a large company. In interviews, everyone talked about politics and 'navigating stakeholders.' Multiple people warned me about specific executives. The role has been open for 8 months."

**Output:**

## Corruption Diagnosis

### Organization
Large company (unspecified), based on interview observations.

### Stage Assessment: 3-4 (Late Stage 3 / Early Stage 4)

### Evidence by Stage

**Stage 1 Indicators (Comfort):**
- Present: Company is large and established—prosperity exists
- Unknown: Whether urgency and discipline have relaxed

**Stage 2 Indicators (Private Interest):**
- Present: Focus on "navigating stakeholders" over delivering value
- Present: Interviewers warn about specific individuals (political landscape matters)

**Stage 3 Indicators (Wrong People):**
- Present: Role open 8 months suggests either impossible requirements or political blockage
- Present: Warnings about executives indicate known bad actors who remain in power
- Present: "Politics" mentioned by multiple interviewers—it's normalized

**Stage 4 Indicators (Governance Failure):**
- Likely: 8-month open role suggests decision-making paralysis
- Unknown: Whether obvious problems go unsolved broadly

**Stage 5 Indicators (Collapse/Tyranny):**
- Not evident yet

### Key Diagnostic Findings
| Indicator | Assessment | Evidence |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Why people seek leadership | Unclear | Not enough data |
| How decisions are made | Corrupt | "Navigating stakeholders" = politics over merit |
| What happens to truth-tellers | Likely punished | People warn privately about executives |
| How problems are addressed | Avoided | Role open 8 months |
| Who gets promoted | Unknown | Need more data |
| Treatment of rules | Unknown | Need more data |

### Prognosis
Without intervention, Stage 4 organizations progress to crisis. The known bad actors will remain unless external shock (board action, market collapse, scandal) forces change. Political navigation will consume your energy; actual contribution will be secondary.

### Reform Possibility
**The Reform Paradox:** You would be joining at mid-level. You cannot reform this organization. The corrupt dynamics predate you and will outlast you. The question is only: can you survive and benefit despite the corruption, or will it consume you?

### Recommendations
**For leadership:** (They're not asking you)
**For you:**
1. Ask directly in final interviews: "What happened to the last person in this role? Why is it open so long?"
2. Get specific about reporting structure—are you reporting to one of the warned-about executives?
3. Negotiate hard—they need you more than you need them (8 months!)
4. If you take it: Set a time limit. Decide now what would make you leave in 18 months.
5. Consider whether the resume line is worth the cost. It might be. But know what you're buying.

### The Machiavellian Verdict
The interviewers told you the truth, in the way people in corrupt organizations tell truths: indirectly, through warnings and hints. Believe them. This is not a place where virtue will be rewarded; it is a place where political skill determines survival. If you are skilled at politics and want the credential, enter with eyes open. If you want to do great work, look elsewhere.
